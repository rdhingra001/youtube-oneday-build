# The Youtube One-Day Build

This is my youtube app that I created to feature my friend, Rohil's youtube videos. He has done so much for me, so I decided to create a little special app for him. Below you will find all of my source code that I used, and I added an additional file containing the data for the API Keys, so you can download it and put in your own keys and URLs. That way, you can also turn it into a Youtube app that features your channel!

Please note that this project has not been finished yet, and there are going to be some unresolved issues and problems. Stay tuned so you can be the first one to use this template when it's done!

Happy Coding!
